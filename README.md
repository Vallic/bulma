## Getting Started

### Install npm dependencies with
`npm install`

_This command looks at `package.json` and installs all the npm dependencies specified in it._

### Compile SCSS into CSS
`npm run scss`

_This command "watches" the `scss` directory such that every time a .scss file in that directory is edited it's compiled and written to the `assets` directory.
